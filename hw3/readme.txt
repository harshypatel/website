For this assignment, inclass2 helped me alot with HW3.
I used base code from w3schools.com/html/ and then edited according to my code.
I did the same thing back in inclass2 assignment. 
For most of them, I just had to change margin, background, and padding.
The color might not be the exact as the page given but I think its really close.
