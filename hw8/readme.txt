Homework: 8 Implementing a Bit of Scrabble with Drag-and-Drop
Date: Dec 15th 2020

Mywebsite: https://harshypatel.github.io/website/hw8/index.html

Extra point: I added a full working scrabble board but I did NOT implement, if a user enter a word that is valid or not. My program doesn't validate the word.

Working Features:  • (4) letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the
			proper distribution of the letters
	• (4) letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares
	• (4) program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square
	• (4) board includes bonus squares
	• (4) score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers
	• (3) any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles
	• (3) the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played
	• (3) after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand”
		back to 7 tiles are selected
	• (3) score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new gam
	• (2) Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them
		anywhere else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.
	• (2) Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can not be moved.
	• (2) Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or
		below another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
	• (2) user can always restart the game.
			
NOT WORKING features: 
		     -> My program does not print the remaining tile count.
		     -> When user selects a blank tile my prgram does not update it to what the user wants. 
		     -> For Example: if user wants the blank tile to be "E" it doesnt do that.

Sources: linked through the program and also used my friends guidence.
