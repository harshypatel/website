-> The program initially starts with pressing button. 
-> First the program validates if the user input is correct and then validates slider.
-> If the user input and slider input matches are correct then it creates a tab
-> If the user changes the value after pressing regenerate table then it is going to create a new tab
-> A user can have up to 12 tabs at maximum and a user can also close them individually
-> A user can also press "delete all" to delete all the tabs at once
