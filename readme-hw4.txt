I picked this bootstrap template from an open source I have cited it along the css files. 

- It has android menu, burger menu for both desktop and mobile version. 
- This website is an upgrade from my last hw2, which was really basic and only used css.
- This includes page animation, awesome icons, jQuery and constomizable
- I have documented index.html as well as most of the css files
